          Milford Sound is the only fiord in New Zealand accessible by car. It
          is well known as one of the wettest inhabited places in the world with
          an average rainfall over 6000mm per year. So, don't forget your
          raincoat! With such heavy rainfall you can be sure to see the true
          beauty of this place. Rain creates dozens of beautiful waterfalls all
          over the fiord. The best way how to enjoy Milford Sound is a
          <strong>cruise</strong>. You can choose from many companies, but I can
          assure you that all tours are more or less the same. If you are lucky
          enough you might be able to see native wildlife such as fur seals or
          even Fiordland penguins. 🐧
          <br />
          Another highlight in this area is so called
          <strong>Milford Road</strong>. This 119km long road is part of the
          State Highway 94 and connects Te Anau with Milford Sound. There are
          many amazing spots worth stopping for such as Mirror Lakes or Homer
          Tunnel leading to picturesque Cleddau Valley. See more info
